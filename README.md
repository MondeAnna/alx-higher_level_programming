#### Requirements: General

* Allowed editors:
    * _[vi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vi-editor-unix/)_
    * _[vim](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getting-started-with-vim-editor-in-linux/)_
    * _[emacs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/emacs-command-in-linux-with-examples/)_

* All source code:
    * Will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `python3` version `3.8.5`
    * Is to end with a new line
    * The length of your files will be tested using wc

* A README.md file at:
    * The root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
    * The folder of each project, containing a description of the project

<br />

#### Requirements: Python Scripts

* All source code:
    * Will be interpreted/compiled using `python3` version `3.8.5`
    * The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
    * Your code should use the `pycodestyle` version `2.8.*`
    * All your files must be executable

<br />

#### Requirements: Shell Scripts

* All source code:
    * The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
    * All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print `2`)
    * All your files must be executable

<br />

#### Requirements: C Scripts

* All source code:
    * Will be compiled using `gcc`, with the options
        * `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
    * Not to use `stdlib's` _[system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-call-in-c/)_
    * To have no errors and no warnings during compilation
    * To use the _[Betty](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty)_ style.
    * To have it's best practices checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
    * Global variables are not allowed
    * No more than 5 functions per file
    * The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
    * Don't forget to push your header file
    * All your header files should be include guarded
    * Should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(\__import__("my_module").\__doc__)')
    * Should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(\__import__("my_module").MyClass.\__doc__)')
    * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(\__import__("my_module").my_function.\__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(\__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.\__doc__)')
    * A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining what's the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

<br />

#### Notice on the checking of Python projects

* Based on the requirements of each task, **you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first**, before you actually code anything
* The intranet checks for Python projects won't be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don't miss any edge case. **But not in the implementation of them!**
* **Don't trust the user**, always think about all possible edge cases

<br />
