#### Resources

* _[`Object Oriented Programming`](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)_
    * Read everything until the paragraph `Inheritance`, excluded.
    * You do **NOT** have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet
* _[`Object-Oriented Programming`](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php)_
    * Please **be careful**: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DONâ€™T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, â€œData Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,â"Public, Protected, and Private Attributes"
* _[`Properties vs. Getters and Setters`](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php)_
* _[`Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE)_
* _[`Python Classes and Objects`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s)_
* _[`Object Oriented Programming`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DP1i2ZU9gk)_

<br />
